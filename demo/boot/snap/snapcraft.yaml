summary: Echo service for image boot test
description: |
  LP: #1625732 - an autopkgtest boot test.  This snap is loaded into an image
  created by ubuntu-image using --extra-snaps.  It implements an echo service
  which starts on boot and which the autopkgtest pings once the image is
  booted.  If it connects and returns the expected results, the test passes.
